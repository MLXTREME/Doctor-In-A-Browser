# What is Doctor In A Browser?
Doctor In A Browser, as the name suggests, is like a doctor in a browser, basically in the form of a Web Application. What does this doctor do, I hear you asked? It is a diagonistic tool. As we know, diagnosis is the first step in any treatment. So, quick and accurate diagnosis can be life saving. 

So, how does it diagnose diseases? Well, it harnesses the power of Machine Learning. Machine Learning, as we know, can be used to learn complex features from data, which can be game changing in the field of disease diagnosis. 

It also produces a report, with a certificate. This report and certificate are mailed to the user for further usability and treatment. 

# Machine Learning Models Supported in Doctor In A Browser
1. **Maternal Health Chatbot** : Pregnancy is an uncertain time for the mothers carrying the foetus. A lot of questions arise in the minds of the to be mothers, especially for the first baby, which they are maybe afraid or too shy of judgement to ask others. Here is where the Maternal Health chatbot comes in. It is a Frequently Asked Questions based Chatbot on subjects such as the diet to be consumed and the physical activity to go through during the phase of Pregnancy. It will help to be mothers clear their doubts and a smoother 9 months of carrying the baby.

2. **COVID-19 Detection From CT Scan** : We have been in a pandemic situation for more than a year now. Even today we don't have a system of detecting whether a certain person is infected by COVID-19 with near perfect accuracy. We have an average error of about 0% to 30% , which can be catastrophic, especially for the false negative cases. So, we have made a COVID-19 detection model which uses the Computer Tomography Scan of the lungs to detect the presence of the deadly virus. Our model gives a testing accuracy of 88% , which is better than the existing methods.
